## Overview
[Little Esty Shop](https://little-esty-shop-jwld.herokuapp.com/admin) is a 12-day project assigned during Module 2 of Turing's Back-end Development Progam. Using Ruby on Rails, the app builds out CRUD functionality in a multi-relational databse using RESTful routes according to MVC principles and using TDD via RSpec. Additional gems used include: `capybara`, `pry`, `launchy`, `simplecov`, `orderly`, `vcr`, and `webmock`.

## Learning Goals
- Practice designing a normalized database schema and defining model relationships
- Utilize advanced routing techniques including namespacing to organize and group like functionality together
- Utilize advanced active record techniques to perform complex database queries
- Practice consuming a public API while utilizing POROs as a way to apply OOP principles to organize code
